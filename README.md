## 🤖 **AI-Powered Model for Vehicle Damage Detection and Classification**

Our application integrates two specialized models, each developed to handle specific aspects of car damage analysis:

### 🔍 **Car Damage Detection Model**  
- **Architecture**: YOLOv8n  
- **Why YOLOv8n?**  
   is lightweight, fast, and highly efficient for object detection tasks, making it ideal for detecting damaged regions on vehicles.  
- **Goal**: EAccurately detect areas of damage on vehicle images and draw bounding boxes around the detected regions.  

### 🗂️ **Car Damage Classification Model**  
- **Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Why MobileNetV2?**  
   MobileNetV2 is optimized for recognizing patterns and features, making it an excellent choice for classifying damage severity. Additionally, its lightweight design ensures efficiency.  
- **Goal**: Classify the severity of damage into three categories: Minor, Moderate, Severe.
